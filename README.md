## Known errors

### VoiceOver does not run this script as a command

In MacOS Catalina some scripts have problems to execute UI commands when they are called by VoiceOver.
You can run scripts or applications as VoiceOver commands. Try to convert this AppleScript as an Application and run the exported application instead running the script.
